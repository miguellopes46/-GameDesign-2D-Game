Brief Resume:
You just got lost in the Blisterwood forest, the most dangerous place in the Kingdom. 
Get your ideas together, ask the locals for help if needed, and if necessary, violence IS a solution. 
You need a team to get out of there though. The woods between the Capital
and the village you're at are too much for one newby adventurer wanna-be. 
There's a coach stable in the north. Use it to reach the capital. 
But will this all be over when you arrive there?
You'll have to find out.
